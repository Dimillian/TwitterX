# [![TwitterX](/README/logo.png)](#)

An educational project aiming to maintain Twitter for macOS working while adding new features...
All this, by injecting code into the official binary.

## Why

Twitter for macOS provides the best *native and free* experience, although it lacks some features
available on the web version.

## How

For this project to work you need to have Twitter for macOS in your computer. Twitter removed the
application from the macOS AppStore but if you ever installed the application it will still be
available under the **purchases** section of the AppStore.

TwitterX is a framework that once it is loaded modifies the application behaviour on runtime. This
project provides **LaucherX**, an application that eases the task of loading TwitterX.

[Download LaucherX](https://github.com/nakiostudio/TwitterX/releases)

Drag the Twitter application and drop it into LauncherX, it will launch the modified version of the
Twitter app. Next time you execute LauncherX it will automatically run the hack.

If you want to run the unmodified version of Twitter simply open the Twitter application instead of
LauncherX.

**This project does not and will never modify the Twitter binary. Upsetting Twitter is not among the
goals of this project therefore modifying or distributing code copyrighted by Twitter will never be
an option.**

## Future

The biggest milestone for this project is switching APIs once Twitter shuts down the API backing the
macOS application in June 2018, whether this will be feasible or not it is still hard to tell.
